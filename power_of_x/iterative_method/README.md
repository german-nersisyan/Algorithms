# Iterative Method for Power Calculation

The iterative method calculates `x^n` using a simple loop. It multiplies `x` by itself `n` times.

## How It Works

The method uses the following logic:

1. Initialize a result variable to 1.
2. Loop from 0 to `n-1` and multiply the result by `x` in each iteration.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
